# Too Many Linked Lists — Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal Rust code as I work through the book **"Too Many Linked Lists"**:
https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/

The goal here is simply to document my learning while following along with the chapters and exercises.

## Notes

- `src/my_naive_impl.rs` is my *own naive attempt* at implementing a linked list **before** reading the book.
- It’s intentionally kept as-is for posterity and comparison with the approaches presented in the text.

Everything else in the repo follows along with the book’s progression.
